## DESCRIPTION
Using matplotlib and seaborn, this Python application gathers real-time data from the OpenWeatherMap API and converts it into several interactive charts and gauges, so generating a complete weather visualization dashboard.  Users of the application enter their API key and city name first, then create a professional dashboard including a temperature gauge, weather condition icons, circular meters for humidity and pressure, a wind direction compass, and a 5-day forecast chart.  While generating both an interactive display and automatically stored high-resolution PNG files, the program exhibits key programming skills including API integration, data visualization, object-oriented design, and error management.  It is a useful tool for real weather monitoring as well as a great portfolio project showing how to convert public API raw JSON data into relevant, aesthetically pleasing dashboards anyone could quickly understand.
